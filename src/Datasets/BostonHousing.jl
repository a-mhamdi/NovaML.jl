    load_boston(; return_X_y=false)

Load and return the Boston House Prices dataset.

The Boston House Prices dataset is a classic regression dataset.

Parameters:
-----------
return_X_y : bool, default=false
    If True, returns `(X, y)` instead of a dict-like object.

Returns:
--------
data : Dict or Tuple
    Dict with the following items:
        data : Matrix{Float64}
            The feature matrix (506 samples, 13 features).
        target : Vector{Float64}
            The target values (506 samples).
        feature_names : Vector{String}
            The names of the dataset columns.
    If `return_X_y` is True, returns a tuple `(X, y)` instead.

Description:
------------
The Boston House Prices dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census 
Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. It was obtained from the 
StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston), and has been used 
extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms.

Attribute Information:
    1. CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
    2. ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
    3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
    5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
    7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    8. DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
    10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000
    11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
    12. B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
    13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population
    14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000's

Note: The dataset might not be available for direct download due to ethical concerns. 
In that case, we'll use a pre-downloaded version or create a synthetic dataset based on its structure.
